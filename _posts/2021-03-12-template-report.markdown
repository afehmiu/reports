### The Team
- Your team members names.

### Problem Definition
- This section explains the problem the team is solving, discusses related work, and proposes and justifies their solution.
- Explain the main contributions of your project (e.g. improving model performance, improving latency, getting it to work on edge, novel use case, etc.)

### System Design
- This section details the key components of the system, including, but not limited to, data pipelines, modeling, deployment, and UX.
- If applicable, a diagram is included to illustrate the interplay between system components. [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is pretty awesome for sketches.
- This section explains and justifies central design decisions, including that of which technologies the team chose to use to support their system.

### Machine Learning Component
- This section explains the ML model(s) that powers the application, the data it’s trained on, and the iterative development of that model.

### System Evaluation
- This section describes the team’s efforts to validate and evaluate their system performance as well as its limitations, both at instance-level and system-level.
- The results are included and presented in a clear and informative manner.

### Application Demostration
- This section includes visuals (screengrab, embedded video link) showcasing the main feature set of the application.
- The section also includes brief justifications of core interface decisions made by the team (e.g. why did the team feel that a Web Application interface would be superior to an API interface given the context of their problem?).
- Instructions on how to use the application.

### Reflection
- This section provides a comprehensive post-mortem on the project, including - but not limited to - answering the following:
	- What worked? (In terms of technology, design decisions, team dynamics, etc.).
	- What didn’t work? What would you improve next time?
	- If given unlimited time and resources, what would you add to your application?
	- If you have plans to move forward with this application, what are they? (We’re always excited to see how students use the tools they’ve learned in this class to pursue topics they’re excited about!)

### Broader Impacts
- This section discusses intended uses of your application - and possible unintended uses, and the associated harms.
- This section reflects upon the design decisions that the team undertook to mitigate harms associated with unintended use of the system.

### Contributions
- Write down a brief summary of the individual contributions of each of the team members.

### References
- Correctly and comprehensively cites any sources used to assist the development of the application, including, but not limited to, papers, tutorials, and interviews/conversations.
